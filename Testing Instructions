Steps for Testing
-	Open the application on your computer. If you are testing the .exe version, double-click to start the program.

Input Validation
-	Enter a valid time in the format HH:MM:SS (e.g., 00:25:00). Confirm that the timer starts when you click "Start."
-	Test invalid inputs (e.g., 99:99:99 or text like hello) and confirm that an error message appears.

Countdown Functionality

-	Observe the timer as it counts down. Ensure the display updates every second.
-	Verify the motivational text, "Get to work, it's concentration time!" appears while the timer runs.

Break Notification
-	Allow the timer to reach zero. Confirm that the message, "Break Time, you've earned it!" displays and that the sound plays.

NB: Test multiple countdown sessions to confirm the app performs consistently.

Expected Results
-	Valid inputs start the timer correctly.
-	Invalid inputs trigger error messages without crashing the application.
-	The timer counts down accurately, displaying motivational text during the session.
-	The app displays a break notification when the timer ends (completes the countdown).
